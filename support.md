Playtime Tracker is completely free, however, if you want to, you can go to [my Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/nanew) and donate.

In case you do, you will recieve a 'supporter' role on [the discord server](https://discord.gg/DxYp6pma3D).

It's appreciated, but not necessary. Please put yourself first and don't donate money you need yourself - **Simply using the mod, spreading the word and telling others about it is already enough support for me!** :)
